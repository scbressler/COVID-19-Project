Tracking the COVID-19 coronavirus spread in the US

This is a MATLAB-based analysis of the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus in the United States.

Data for the number confirmed cases and deaths was taken from the New York Times GitHub repository:
  https://nytimes/covid-19-data
  
World data was taken from:
https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/full_data.csv

The covid19.m script plots:
  The trajectory of the spread of the disease by the multi-day average of new confirmed cases against
  the total number of confirmed cases, highlighting the exponential spread of the disease across all
  50 states and 5 US territories
